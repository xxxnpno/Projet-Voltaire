# Projet Voltaire

**Projet Voltaire** is a clipboard monitoring program that automatically detects strings in your clipboard and sends them to the Reverso API for grammar and spelling corrections. The project uses `cURL` for HTTP requests and `nlohmann/json` for JSON parsing.

## Features

- **Real-time Clipboard Monitoring**: Continuously watches the clipboard for text content.
- **Automated Grammar and Spelling Correction**: Sends clipboard strings to the Reverso API and retrieves corrected text.

## Recommended Tools

For enhanced functionality, it is recommended to use **Microsoft PowerToys** (or a similar tool) alongside Projet Voltaire. PowerToys includes a feature for extracting text from images, making it easy to correct strings from screenshots.
